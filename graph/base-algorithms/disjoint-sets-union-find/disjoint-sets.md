# Disjoint sets

Example problems to solve with disjoint sets are:

1. Find if two elements are in the same set.
1. Find the number of sets
1. Find the size of a set.
1. Find the root of an element.
1. Find the size of the largest set.
1. Find the size of the smallest set.

For all of these problems, use union-find with path compression and rank.
