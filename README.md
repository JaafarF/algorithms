# Algorithms

This is a repo for solutions to random programming and algorithm challenges, like LeetCode.com, adventofcode.com and similar.

LeetCode problems are denoted as `lc-e-70-climbing-stairs.py` for example where lc = LeetCode, e = easy, 70 = 70th problem, and climbing-stairs = problem name.

AdventOfCode problems are denoted as `aoc-2016-11-shortet-path.py` for example where aoc = AdventOfCode, 2016-11=day, and then a description of the problem.
