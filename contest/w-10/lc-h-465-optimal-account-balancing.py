'''
A group of friends went on holiday and sometimes lent each other money.
For example, Alice paid for Bill's lunch for $10.
Then later Chris gave Alice $5 for a taxi ride.

We can model each transaction as a tuple (x, y, z) which means
person x gave person y $z.

Assuming Alice, Bill, and Chris are person 0, 1, and 2 respectively
(0, 1, 2 are the person's ID), the transactions can be represented as
[[0, 1, 10], [2, 0, 5]].

Given a list of transactions between a group of people,
return the minimum number of transactions required to settle the debt.

Note: A transaction will be given as a tuple (x, y, z).
Note that x â‰  y and z > 0. Person's IDs may not be linear,
e.g. we could have the persons 0, 1, 2 or we could also have the persons
0, 2, 6.
