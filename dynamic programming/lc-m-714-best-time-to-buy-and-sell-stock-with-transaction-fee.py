You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day, and an integer fee representing a transaction fee.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

ALGO (from solution)
At the end of the i-th day, we maintain cash, the maximum profit we could have if we did not have a share of stock, and hold, the maximum profit we could have if we owned a share of stock.

To transition from the i-th day to the i+1-th day, we either sell our stock cash = max(cash, hold + prices[i] - fee) or buy a stock hold = max(hold, cash - prices[i]). At the end, we want to return cash. We can transform cash first without using temporary variables because selling and buying on the same day can't be better than just continuing to hold the stock.
