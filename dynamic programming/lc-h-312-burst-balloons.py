ARRAYS - DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING

You are given n balloons, indexed from 0 to n - 1. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by an array nums.
You are asked to burst all the balloons.

If you burst the ith balloon, you will get nums[i - 1] * nums[i] * nums[i + 1] coins. If i - 1 or i + 1 goes out of bounds of the array,
then treat it as if there is a balloon with a 1 painted on it.

Return the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.
